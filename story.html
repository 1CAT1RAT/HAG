    <h1>THE MULTIVERSE STORY</h1>
    <p>The story of the multiverse begins with a choice. A moment where reality fractured into infinite possibilities, each one spawning its own timeline, its own characters, its own consequences.</p>
    
    <h2>The Genesis Event</h2>
    <p>In the beginning, there was unity. A single world, held together by bonds both visible and invisible. But something changed. A threshold was crossed, a line was drawn, and the fabric of existence began to fray at the edges.</p>
    <p>This is where our story takes place—in the aftermath, among the shattered pieces of what was and the uncertain forms of what could be.</p>

    <h2>Characters Bound by Fate</h2>
    <p>Across the multiverse, characters emerge as key players in a grand narrative. Some are allies, bound by shared purpose. Others are rivals, locked in eternal conflict. And many exist in the space between, unsure of their place in this fractured world.</p>
    <p>Their relationships—measured not in simple terms of friend or foe, but in the complex mathematics of connection and opposition—drive the story forward.</p>

    <h2>The Matrix of Existence</h2>
    <p>Every interaction matters. Every choice cascades across dimensions. The relationships between characters form a matrix of influence, a web of cause and effect that binds the multiverse together. Strong connections breed alliance. Opposing forces create tension. And neutral parties hold the balance.</p>
    <p>This is the lens through which we understand the multiverse. Not as separate worlds, but as an interconnected system where every character's actions ripple across realities.</p>
